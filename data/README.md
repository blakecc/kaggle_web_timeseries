# Data directory

The purpose of this folder is to store all read only data used in the project. It's critical that none of the data stored in this directory is altered - intermediate data should either be stored in /output, or used in memory within an R script.

The main files from the Kaggle competition are included in .gitignore because they exceed the GitHub file size limit. Please ensure that you download and unzip these into this folder on your local machine:
 - key_1.csv
 - sample_submission_1.csv
 - train_1.csv
